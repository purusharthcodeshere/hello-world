Hello World! This is F3!

We are learning Git and gitBash today! Its been fun.


Hello everyone! This is F3 again!
This is now being changed. 
We are updating the file to see how the changes are being made to a file and how do we commit those changes.
We are now going to re-commit the file.

I just made more changes to the file. 20th Nov 2024. 0108 hours! Kudos! 
Happy Birthday Papa! :) You'll always be an inspiration to me. <3

We are learning git again. If you see this, you are seeing my coding journey.
